## Overview

Every day over 450 million photos and videos are being uploaded to Facebook and Instagram. The exponential growth of visual media has made quality assessment become increasingly important for various applications, including image and video acquisition, synthesis, restoration, enhancement, search and retrieval, storage, and recognition. 

Broadly, visual quality assessment techniques can be divided into image and video technical quality assessment (IQA and VQA, or broadly TQA) and aesthetics quality assessment (AQA). TQA focuses on the effect of image-level technical aspects of perceived quality, such as sharpness, noise, color reproduction, contrast, dynamic range, and others. On the other hand, AQA deals with more abstract aesthetics-related quality factors that capture the subjective aesthetics experience. Aesthetics judgments are associated with the adherence to established photographic rules encompassing lighting (emphasis, contrast), composition, colors, and more. Even though these topics have mostly been studied independently, they represent tightly related aspects of the same underlying subjective experience of media items, value judgments. 

This workshop aims to bring together individuals in the two fields of TQA and AQA for sharing of ideas and discussions on current trends, developments, issues, and future directions, with the vision to accelerate the progress of research in both fields. Our hope is that bridging TQA and AQA, will result in a better understanding of quantitative measures of quality of experience in the broader context of multimedia applications.

### Scope 

The scope of this workshop spans:
* **Analysis and prediction of aesthetic and technical visual quality**, encompassing absolute and comparative judgments about visual media:
  * Traditional and deep-learning-based approaches
  * Aesthetics and QoE related concepts such as interestingness, popularity, viralness
* **Datasets for TQA and AQA**, including:
  * New approaches to data collection procedures and sources
  * New data augmentation methods	
* **Applications of TQA and AQA** in computer vision or image processing tasks:
  * Visual filtering and retrieval (recommendation, image gallery/video)
  * Visual editing (recomposition, retargeting, cropping)
  * Assessment guided visual enhancement
  * Real-world systems and applications
  * Applications to media such as light fields, 360 or stereo, point clouds.
